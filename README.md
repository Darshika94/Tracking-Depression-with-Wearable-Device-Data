# Tracking-Depression-with-Wearable-Device-Data

This study looks at how to detect depression using physical activity data from wearable actigraphy devices. Using an openly available dataset, the analysis starts with summary statistics and behavioral feature extraction: average activity, standard deviation, maximum activity, and total activity per day. These features help differentiate between healthy and depressed participants. I use machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with reproducible participant-level splits (60:20:20 train/validation/test ratio). I evaluate the models through F1 scores, ROC, and AUC curves. Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna and GPU acceleration significantly improves performance. Random Forest achieves the best macro F1-score of 0.74 and AUC of 0.82. I use SHAP analysis to improve interpretability, which confirms that activity patterns are relevant behavioral indicators. The results show that ensemble and boosting methods, along with strong experimental controls, effectively differentiate depression. This supports the use of sensor-based analytics in mental health research.
